So new week, new developer killer application. This week we have Bolt.new with us and it's quite good actually. We've been playing around with this making small small apps, looking at other videos and what others are able to achieve with it. And honestly it's wild. It's everything in one place. You don't have to copy paste anything. You don't even have to install libraries, install packages, debug, think of styling. It does everything on its own, which is browser based like Vivo, chatting like cloud and editable like cursor. And it's even free to try. built by the team at StackBlitz, which is an online IDE or simply speaking a development environment right in your browser. While this thread is filled with examples which you can check on StackBlitz's Twitter. Let's get started with something we will make right in front of your eyes.
